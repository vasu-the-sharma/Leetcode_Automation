# Leetcode_Automation

In this Automation Project,I have tried to automate the famous online coding platform 'LeetCode' to open N number of questions and submit answers based on the correct submissions of others while you listen to your favorite track in the background. This is a simple yet elegant automation script written using Node.js and Puppeteer. The user has to just run the 'pep.bat' file from VS Code which uses the credentials file, the number of questions needed to be solved and the song that is to be played. 

Any more feedbacks/suggestions to make it more responsive are welcomed.

Library used: Puppeteer

Framework used: Node js

Language used: JavaScript
